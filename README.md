# CoinSafe-Project-Embedded-System-
%This project describes a simple, password-protected safe that allows the user to open it once the correct password is entered. The safe permits the user to choose a 7-character password containing specific numbers, letters, and/or symbols. Additionally, the safe sorts American coins based on their value and displays the total value of the coins inside.%
